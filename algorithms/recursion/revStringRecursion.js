/*
Reverse a string — recursion
There are many different ways to reverse a string, but let’s get our hands dirty with recursion! What is recursion? Recursion is just a function that calls on itself! Two important rules of recursion:

1) Base case — the conditions that stops your recursive function (refraining your function from an infinite loop).
2) Step case — function that calls upon itself with a sub-argument of the initially invoked argument.
