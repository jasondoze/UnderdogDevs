// 1. Shuffle the array
// Imagine the supplied array is like a pack of cards. Write a function to 
// shuffle this array in to a completely new and entirely random order, much 
// like shuffling a pack of cards.

const shuffle = (someArray) => {
    // your code
}

console.log(shuffle([10, 12, 15])) // [12, 15, 10]
