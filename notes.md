Big O notation 

Here's my favorite Big O analogy: Let's say you're making dinner for your family. O is the process of following a recipe, and n is the number of times you follow a recipe. O- you make one dish that everyone eats whether they like it or not. You follow one recipe from top to bottom, then serve (1recipe). <-- How I grew up O(n) - you make individual dishes for each person. You follow a recipe from top to bottom for each person in your family (recipe times the number of people in your family). O(n^2) - you make individual dishes redundantly for every person. You follow all recipes for each person in your family (recipe times the number of people squared). O (log n) - you break people into groups according to what they want and make larger portions. You make one dish for each group (recipe times request)
