Setting up storage to use during a for loop, including counters and arrays

What is the shortest country name? Make sure your solution can handle ties.
What countries use only one vowel in their name (the vowel can be used multiple times)

Nested for loops

There is at least one baby name from the top 40 baby names for 2020 that, when spelled backwards, is a valid Scrabble word. Find and print all such names.
    Solve this two ways: first with an array to hold the Scrabble words, and then with a dictionary (or set) to hold the Scrabble words. Use timer functions to measure how long it takes to complete this work under each implementation. Why is the time different?
What are all of the names that were top 40 baby names in both 1880 and 2020?
